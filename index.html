						<span class="title">Service Partially Restored</span>
						<p>As of ~1am EST Sunday, June 7, StoryShop's servers have been partially restored. We're still working through the issue, and are only downgrading to "degraded performance" status for now, but many users should be able to regain access to the app. There is a chance users will end up stuck in a redirect whirlpool; most likely seeing the "StoryShop is currently in private beta." message. Following is a possible (though not guaranteed) fix, depending on the underlying cause of a user's instance of the problem: 

1. Assuming a page with the address of http://storyshopapp.com/#/beta
2. Click the address bar and manually delete the 'beta' part, leaving just http://storyshopapp.com/#/ - then hit the "enter" key on the keyboard 
3. Hopefully that'll lead to a page showing just the word "Login" - now click the refresh button in the browser, it should flash the Google login button, then redirect into the app.</p>

						<span class="title">Major Server Outages and Rolling Brown-Outs</span>
						<p>As of the morning of Saturday, June 4, StoryShop is experiencing major server issues in the Amazon cloud. The most common symptom of this issue appears to be getting stuck on a screen which states "StoryShop is currently in private beta."

At times when the issue is less severe, server and connectivity issues also appear to be related to intermittent problems with the `Create` and `+` buttons not working for Characters, Elements, Outlines and Worlds; and may be related to reports of file upload problems.

Thank you to all for your continued patience while we iron out these unexpected kinks during these first few days of beta testing!
