						<span class="title">StoryShop Servers Down - Amazon Elastic Beanstalk Instances Failing</span>
						<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of ~12:30am EST Monday, June 6, we are once again suffering major service outages.

It seems we are experiencing a phenomenon wherein StoryShop's performance gradually degrades until all systems experience catastrophic failure. We are also receiving reports from our database service provider that there exist an abnormally high number of active connections, which could be related.

We are starting to suspect there may be a connection between the intermittent issues with Create and + buttons not working and the pattern we are seeing of server performance degradation followed by failure.

Our hope is that there is a single underlying bug, exposed only under the strain of hundreds of real users interacting with the system, that will resolve all our major problems once it's found & squashed.

Please check back here to see if this has been resolved. Thank you!

						<span class="title">Create and + Buttons Intermittently Not Working</span>
						<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of ~4pm EST Sunday, June 5, we are downgrading the app status urgency from `downgraded performance` to `investigating`.

All server and database systems in the Amazon cloud appear to be stable and operational, but we are continuing to receive reports of the `Create` and `+` buttons not working . Though it would seem the problem is occurring most frequently with `Characters` and `Outlines`, we have also received reports of `Elements` and `Worlds` not working as well.

The majority of reports are coming in from users on Windows 10 browsing with the latest version of Chrome 50, but several reports have also come from users on Mac running Safari, and a couple have come from other combinations of operating system & browser as well.

Evidence so far indicates that at the root of the problem is an unpredictable amount of delay between clicking the button and the operation completing. Sometimes it is virtually instantaneous, other times we've seen it take as long as 20 seconds, and frequently the created item never appears at all.

We are continuing to investigate this issue, and will greatly appreciate any new information not included above. Please send any relevant details via the "Contact support" link on our feedback site at http://feedback.storyshopapp.com

Thanks to all for helping track this one down!

						<span class="title">Service Partially Restored</span>
						<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of ~1am EST Sunday, June 5, StoryShop's servers have been partially restored. We're still working through the issue, and are only downgrading to "degraded performance" status for now, but many users should be able to regain access to the app. There is a chance users will end up stuck in a redirect whirlpool; most likely seeing the "StoryShop is currently in private beta." message. Following is a possible (though not guaranteed) 3-step fix, depending on the underlying cause of a user's instance of the problem: 

1. Assuming a page with the address of http://storyshopapp.com/#/beta

2. Click the address bar and manually delete the 'beta' part, leaving just http://storyshopapp.com/#/ - then hit the "enter" key on the keyboard.

3. Hopefully that'll lead to a page showing just the word "Login" - now click the refresh button in the browser, it should flash the Google login button, then redirect into the app.</p>

						<span class="title">Major Server Outages and Rolling Brown-Outs</span>
						<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of the morning of Saturday, June 4, StoryShop is experiencing major server issues in the Amazon cloud. The most common symptom of this issue appears to be getting stuck on a screen which states "StoryShop is currently in private beta."

At times when the issue is less severe, server and connectivity issues also appear to be related to intermittent problems with the `Create` and `+` buttons not working for Characters, Elements, Outlines and Worlds; and may be related to reports of file upload problems.

Thank you to all for your continued patience while we iron out these unexpected kinks during these first few days of beta testing!
