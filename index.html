						<span class="title">Workaround Found for + Button Bug in Safari & Firefox</span>
						<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of ~7pm EST Tuesday, June 14, the lingering bug affecting the behavior of the `+` buttons to create new Worlds, Characters, Elements and Outlines in some browsers, most commonly Safari, has been resolved.

Our research of this problem led to a known bug in one of the libraries powering interaction on the front end of the StoryShop application, Material-UI ( http://www.material-ui.com/ ). There are some cases in which a rapid double-click is required to trigger the button action.

This bug is referenced in the following open issues on the material-ui repository:

`https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/issues/2568`
`https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/issues/4421`
`https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/issues/1396`
`https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/issues/1370`

The common fix is to disable the "ripple" animation for the `+` buttons. However, because this ripple animation is part of the core Material Design spec from Google ( https://material.google.com/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html ), we consider this fix to be a temporary solution, and will monitor the above issues for a permanent upstream resolution to be folded into StoryShop when it is ready.</p>

						<span class="title">StoryShop Service Restored - Continuing to Monitor Closely</span>
						<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of ~2:30p EST Friday, June 10, StoryShop has been restored to an operational state, and we are downgrading status urgency from `major outage` to `investigating` while we monitor performance to confirm the issue & its myriad manifest side effects have, in fact, been resolved.

All teams involved upstream in troubleshooting and correcting the problem, at our database service provider mLab ( http://mlab.com ) and at MongoDB ( https://www.mongodb.com/ ) are playing an active role in ensuring this bug has been absolutely solved; and in taking steps to modify deployment practices to ensure breaking changes are not included in minor patch versions of the Node.js driver moving forward.

We believe that the most noticable improvement in performance for our users will be the behavior of the `Create` and `+` buttons in Characters, Elements and Outlines. Additionally, we believe this will resolve the problem of our beta testers landing on the "StoryShop is currently in private beta." page in error.

Noteworthy is that there is, in fact, a small delay to be expected between the clicking of a `Create` button and the creation of the new item, as the signal is sent from browser to server to database and back. This entire round trip should generally be measurable in milliseconds, but it can sometimes take a few seconds to complete. As we continue to work on improving performance, it is still reasonable to expect maybe as much as a 3 second delay during high traffic times, or a bit longer if you are on a particularly slow connection.

It is also worth mentioning that, in Safari, it can sometimes take a couple clicks in quick succession to get the `+` button to work. Clicks spaced too far apart will have no effect. If clicking a few times swiftly still does nothing, please feel free to bring it to our attention through a support ticket at http://feedback.storyshopapp.com

Our short term plan to aleviate the frustration inherent in beta users not knowing if they are "just waiting a few seconds" or "experiencing another outage" will be to add some sort of "spinner" or "scroller" indicator during brief delays, and proper error messages in case of failure.

Long term, it is part of our larger plan to greater rely on browser local storage so that brief intermittent outages or periods of being disconnected from a live web connection will not interfere with the performance of the app once loaded & cached locally. We also have some planned improvements for the creation process itself that will improve the overall user experience.

==================================
RECOVERY STEPS TO TRY IF NECESSARY
==================================

Now that things are back up and running, some of you may still encounter residual issues related to your browser history and login. Some of you may already be familar with these steps, from previous status updates or ticket on the feedback site, but they are included again here for convenience.

The first thing to try if faced with this is to de-authenticate the StoryShop app from within your Google account itself, then try to log back in. The direct link to change this in your currently-active Google account's permissions settings is https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions

If this step does not work, and you still find yourself trapped at the "private beta" page or elsewhere, you may need to take the following few steps:

1. Assuming a page with the address of http://storyshopapp.com/#/beta

2. Click the address bar and manually delete the 'beta' part, leaving just http://storyshopapp.com/#/ - then hit the "enter" key on the keyboard.

3. Hopefully that'll lead to a page showing just the word "Login" - now click the refresh button in the browser, it should flash the Google login button, then redirect into the app.

If the above steps do not work, there is a chance you successfully accessed StoryShop in the first few hours from a gmail account that was not associated with your Kickstarter account before we discovered a crack in the fence that was letting non-backers in. You will need to either de-authenticate as above, then sign back in under the appropriate address.

If all else fails, please contact us for support through http://feedback.storyshopapp.com so we can update your address in our database to the proper Google account.

==================================

We're so grateful to everyone who has helped us get through these first few days with your informative reports, great ideas, and words of encouragement. Though it felt catastrophic for a spell, your participation is absolutely vital in battle-testing & fire-hardening StoryShop.

Thank you, and welcome back!

						<span class="title">Outage continues, with slow progress being made.</span>
						<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of ~9pm EST Wednesday, June 9, we are still faced with a complete systemwide outage of the StoryShop App. Clues have been found, and variables are being eliminated, but there is nothing new to report.

We remain optimistic, and hope to be back on track soon. We are planning to send out a Kickstarter update late afternoon Friday, June 10, after the live-streamed recording of the latest episode of the Self-Publishing Podcast, in which we discuss the unexpected events of the past week, as well as announce something very exciting on the near horizon for StoryShop.

Until then, we remain grateful for being surrounded by such an incredibly supportive community. Thank you.

						<span class="title">Major outage persists, though it appears we're not alone.</span>
						<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of ~10:45pm EST Monday, June 6, StoryShop is still suffering a complete outage. All traffic is now redirected to a simple landing page with links to the status and feedback sites.

Though the issue is not yet resolved, we have learned from the team at our cloud database service provider that at the root of our sudden and unexpected problems is a newly-discovered bug in recent releases of the Node.js driver for MongoDB.

For those interested in learning more, or in seeing what the real underbelly of engineering at the bleeding edge of web technology looks like, please refer to the following tickets currently being investigated by the core team at MongoDB: 

https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-719
https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-722

As far as we can tell, this bug has been lurking in the shadows for the past week or so, and our small development team had not yet placed sufficient load on the system to cause the results we saw immediately once the strain was multiplied by several orders of magnitude when we opened to our beta testers.

In honor of the mad whirlwind we've found ourselves swept up in over the past few days, here is a link to an image of the first documented software bug - a moth found inside the Harvard Mark II electromechanical computer in 1947: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#/media/File:H96566k.jpg

Hang in there brave new StoryShoppers, the end is in sight... and in the end, the beginning!

						<span class="title">StoryShop Servers Down - Amazon Elastic Beanstalk Instances Failing</span>
						<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of ~12:30am EST Monday, June 6, we are once again suffering major service outages.

It seems we are experiencing a phenomenon wherein StoryShop's performance gradually degrades until all systems experience catastrophic failure. We are also receiving reports from our database service provider that there exist an abnormally high number of active connections, which could be related.

We are starting to suspect there may be a connection between the intermittent issues with Create and + buttons not working and the pattern we are seeing of server performance degradation followed by failure.

Our hope is that there is a single underlying bug, exposed only under the strain of hundreds of real users interacting with the system, that will resolve all our major problems once it's found & squashed.

Please check back here to see if this has been resolved. Thank you!

						<span class="title">Create and + Buttons Intermittently Not Working</span>
						<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of ~4pm EST Sunday, June 5, we are downgrading the app status urgency from `downgraded performance` to `investigating`.

All server and database systems in the Amazon cloud appear to be stable and operational, but we are continuing to receive reports of the `Create` and `+` buttons not working . Though it would seem the problem is occurring most frequently with `Characters` and `Outlines`, we have also received reports of `Elements` and `Worlds` not working as well.

The majority of reports are coming in from users on Windows 10 browsing with the latest version of Chrome 50, but several reports have also come from users on Mac running Safari, and a couple have come from other combinations of operating system & browser as well.

Evidence so far indicates that at the root of the problem is an unpredictable amount of delay between clicking the button and the operation completing. Sometimes it is virtually instantaneous, other times we've seen it take as long as 20 seconds, and frequently the created item never appears at all.

We are continuing to investigate this issue, and will greatly appreciate any new information not included above. Please send any relevant details via the "Contact support" link on our feedback site at http://feedback.storyshopapp.com

Thanks to all for helping track this one down!

						<span class="title">Service Partially Restored</span>
						<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of ~1am EST Sunday, June 5, StoryShop's servers have been partially restored. We're still working through the issue, and are only downgrading to "degraded performance" status for now, but many users should be able to regain access to the app. There is a chance users will end up stuck in a redirect whirlpool; most likely seeing the "StoryShop is currently in private beta." message. Following is a possible (though not guaranteed) 3-step fix, depending on the underlying cause of a user's instance of the problem: 

1. Assuming a page with the address of http://storyshopapp.com/#/beta

2. Click the address bar and manually delete the 'beta' part, leaving just http://storyshopapp.com/#/ - then hit the "enter" key on the keyboard.

3. Hopefully that'll lead to a page showing just the word "Login" - now click the refresh button in the browser, it should flash the Google login button, then redirect into the app.</p>

						<span class="title">Major Server Outages and Rolling Brown-Outs</span>
						<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of the morning of Saturday, June 4, StoryShop is experiencing major server issues in the Amazon cloud. The most common symptom of this issue appears to be getting stuck on a screen which states "StoryShop is currently in private beta."

At times when the issue is less severe, server and connectivity issues also appear to be related to intermittent problems with the `Create` and `+` buttons not working for Characters, Elements, Outlines and Worlds; and may be related to reports of file upload problems.

Thank you to all for your continued patience while we iron out these unexpected kinks during these first few days of beta testing!
